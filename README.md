# Responsive Design Without Bootstrap
This project is a study of Bootstrap, learning how to implement a responsive website without the crutch of a framework. Bootstrap concepts are implemented, but there are no elements in this project containing unnecessary "Bootstrap Bloat."

All artwork is original and created by me, Nate Hadinata. Except for the icons on the bottom, that's from Font Awesome 4.3.

This project is based on the following [Udacity Mockup](https://github.com/nhadinat/Responsive-Design/blob/master/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf "Udacity Mockup for Project 1").

Enjoy,
-Nate
